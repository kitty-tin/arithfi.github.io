## Settlement rules
1. The settlement period is 7 days, with each new settlement period starting at 00:00 UTC+8 on every Monday.
2. During the sub-account clearing process, if the lead trader and their followers have no open positions, the lead trader enters the settlement state. Otherwise, they will enter the sub-account clearing process at the beginning of the next settlement period.
3. The cut-off time for daily profit and loss calculations is set at 00:00 UTC+8. Trades opened after this time will be included in the next day's clearing.
4. A 10% pre-deduction will be taken from the profits of the followers when positions are closed. On the settlement day, the net profit and loss for the entire settlement period will be recalculated, and the corresponding amount will be paid to the lead trader. If there is any remaining pre-deduction amount, it will be returned to the followers.
5. During the settlement period, the lead trader can only receive 10% of the net profit of their followers when the followers' closed orders are profitable. If the followers' closed orders result in losses, the pre-deducted profit-sharing amount will be refunded to the followers on the settlement day.

## Settlement time
Profit calculation period: Every Monday at UTC+8 00:00.

Settlement time: Every Monday at UTC+8 12:00.

At the time of settlement, the total profit and loss generated by the follower during the settlement period will be calculated, resulting in 350 ATF. The actual profit-sharing to be paid to the trader is 35 ATF, as 50 ATF was previously pre-deducted. During the settlement, 35 ATF will be allocated to the trader's fund account, and the excess 15 ATF will be refunded to the follower's following account. If there are unfilled orders among the followers at the moment of settlement, the settlement will not take place until the next settlement day when there are no follower positions left, at which point a complete settlement will occur."
